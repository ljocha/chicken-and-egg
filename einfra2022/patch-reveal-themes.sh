# when going to reveal-3.8.0 we found out that reveal's native themes 
# like simple, sky, and similar, failed to have their global background 
# show up in our slides
# 
# this script patches the original themes as shipping with reveal.js to
# fix this issue
# 
# (*) one thing that goes wrong is when reveal tries to tweak settings 
#     on just the 'body' tag; these don't make it to <body> because they 
#     are too general and get superseded by other css in the jupyter arena
#     so we replace these 'body {' definitions so they apply on
#     a more specific css selector
#
# (*) that is still not enough, it took a while to find out, but 
#     the body tag also needs background-attachment to be reset to fixed,
#     somehow something defines it to 'scroll' which breaks it for those themes
#
